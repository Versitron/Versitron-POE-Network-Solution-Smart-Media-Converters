### 🔌 1. What Is a POE Media Converter?

A **POE (Power over Ethernet) Media Converter** is a networking device that allows you to send both data and electrical power over a single Ethernet cable. It connects copper Ethernet to fiber optics while delivering power to **IP cameras**, **Wireless APs**, or **IoT edge devices**.

#### Key Features:
- Combines **fiber transmission** + **POE power delivery**
- Works in **commercial, industrial**, and **outdoor** deployments
- Supports 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet and standard SFP optics
- Can be **managed** or **unmanaged** depending on control needs
